# THis file is managed by puppet, DO NOT EDIT
#
# The ACL are checked in order of appearance in this file.
#
# Supported syntax:
# This file supports two different syntax depending on how
# you want to express the ACL.
#
# Path syntax (the one used below):
# ---------------------------------
# path /path/to/resource
# [environment envlist]
# [method methodlist]
# [auth[enthicated] {yes|no|on|off|any}]
# allow [host|ip|*]
# deny [host|ip]
#
# The path is matched as a prefix. That is /file match at
# the same time /file_metadat and /file_content.
#
# Regex syntax:
# -------------
# This one is differenciated from the path one by a '~'
#
# path ~ regex
# [environment envlist]
# [method methodlist]
# [auth[enthicated] {yes|no|on|off|any}]
# allow [host|ip|*]
# deny [host|ip]
#
# The regex syntax is the same as ruby ones.
#
# Ex:
# path ~ .pp$
# will match every resource ending in .pp (manifests files for instance)
#
# path ~ ^/path/to/resource
# is essentially equivalent to path /path/to/resource
#
# environment:: restrict an ACL to a specific set of environments
# method:: restrict an ACL to a specific set of methods
# auth:: restrict an ACL to an authenticated or unauthenticated request
# the default when unspecified is to restrict the ACL to authenticated requests
# (ie exactly as if auth yes was present).
#

# Authenticated hosts (identified via ssl cert)

# allow nodes to retrieve their own node definition
path ~ ^/node/([^/]+)$
method find
allow $1

# allow nodes to retrieve their own catalog (ie their configuration)
path ~ ^/catalog/([^/]+)$
method find
allow *

# Note: It appears that regex pattern matching is broken in the current version
# of puppetmaster. When this is repaired, allow $1 will be a safer option.
#allow $1

# allow all nodes to access the certificates services
path /certificate_revocation_list/ca
method find
allow *

# allow all nodes to store their reports
path /report
method save
allow *

# Allow blanket access to fileserver. Note that /etc/puppet/fileserver.conf
# also has access controls within it.
path /file
allow *


# Unauthenticated hosts

# allow access to the master CA
path /certificate/ca
auth no
method find
allow *

path /certificate/
auth no
method find
allow *

path /certificate_request
auth no
method find, save
allow *

# By default, deny everything
path /
auth any
